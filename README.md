# Rollupjs.org

This is the source code for the website!

## Steps to build the website locally

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open up http://localhost:3000


## Adding translations

Translations into other languages are warmly welcomed. Make a copy of the `guide/en` directory, renaming it to your language (e.g. `guide/fr`), and update the markdown files inside. Once done, the translation will be available at `/[lang]`.
