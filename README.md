## Adding translations

Translations into other languages are warmly welcomed. Make a copy of the `guide/en` directory, renaming it to your language (e.g. `guide/fr`), and update the markdown files inside. Once done, the translation will be available at `/[lang]`.

## Style Guidelines

_(Note: This section will be updated on an as-needed basis)_

- Please use `-` for bulleted list items.
- Please set a preferred line length of 100 characters in your editor for Markdown files in this repository.
- Please do not use hard line breaks to format blocks of plain text. Rather, please enable soft-line breaks in your editor.
